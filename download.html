    <h2>Download SAMP-MOBILE on Play Store</h2>
    <p>This particular APK is fully compatible, and its voice chat feature functions seamlessly when used on the server. Unlike other APKs where voice chat tends to malfunction, Samp-Mobile ensures reliable voice communication while in use. I highly recommend Samp-Mobile for its excellent voice chat functionality.</p>

    <h2>ROLEPLAY NAME </h2>
    <p>Once you've entered the IP, set your roleplay name as "Firstname_Lastname." For instance, John_Dod. Your chosen name should be a roleplay name to prevent server removal. Remember, it's not mandatory to use your out-of-character name for roleplay; however, refrain from sharing any out-of-character details in-character.</p>
